========================
Card game WAR now in JAVA form. This program runs with all programs in repository, and uses the card images supplied. The
way the CardImage class determines the correct image is based on the names of these files (used the first letter of rank
and suit).
The game plays with each player dealing 1 card each, face up. The player with the higher ranked card wins the cards, adding 
them to his or her pile. If there is a tie, a WAR is initiated where the players deal out two more cards each, the first one
face down and the second one face up. The higher ranked card is the winner as before.
The game can be ended at any time with the button below Player 1's deck. This button also displays the total number of cards
in your pile. The game continues until this button is pressed, or until either player's decks are empty.
The GAME OVER screen displays the total cards in each players' pile and who the winner is (based on the amount in their pile).
Have fun playing WAR!
